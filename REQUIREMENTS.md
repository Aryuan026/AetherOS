# SullyOS Requirements

## Public Sticker Packs

- A public sticker pack can be shipped with the static web app.
- A public pack can be empty without rendering broken images.
- Public packs default to disabled unless the catalog says otherwise.
- A user can enable or disable a public pack for the current character.
- Disabled packs must not appear in the emoji picker for that character.
- Disabled packs must not be included in private chat AI prompt context.
- Disabled packs must not be included in group chat prompt context except for members that can use them.
- If a group-chat AI tries to send a hidden sticker anyway, execution must re-check target-character visibility before saving the emoji message.
- Public sticker rows should be treated as server-catalog managed, not locally deletable from the picker.

## Storage Boundary

- Static sticker files are shared by everyone who can access the deployed app.
- Character-pack enablement is browser-local and not shared across users/devices.
- Chat records, API settings, and imported local stickers stay browser-local.
